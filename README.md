## Project Summary
Many governments use country-level data points like GDP, happiness indices, and life expectancy to direct and inform their policy making decisions across several aspects of society1. The motivation for this project is to examine how happiness, health and economic factors interact and how those decisions are impacting health outcomes for various countries across the world. In this project we will analyze the links between human happiness and life expectancy using a country happiness dataset from the Gallup World Poll and a country life expectancy dataset from the World Bank. Using these data sources, we believe we can answer questions like ‘Is there a relationship between health and happiness?’
